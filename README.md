Learning how to use GitHub

Hi all! My name is Danielle, and I've joined Protocol Labs today as our Recruiter (my LinkedIn profile will say Talent Acquisition, because I'm fancy like that). I come from another open source community, Chef, and more fundamentally I was born, raised, and currently reside in Seattle (a rare thing nowadays). I have 2 little girls, used to be fluent in Japanese and can still get by in the language, and love to think, talk, and read about packing for travel (but I'm scared of actually flying). I'm super excited to be here, and I look forward to meeting and working with everyone!
